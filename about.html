    <h2>About Mr. Chavez</h2>

    <p><em>Here is a <a href="Chavezresume.pdf">link</a> to my resume.</em></p>
    
    <p>My name is Felipe Chavez, and I currently teach mathematics at Metea
        Valley High School in Aurora, Illinois. I have been a teacher at this school for
        four years. As a high school teacher, I plan and deliver well thought out and
        engaging mathematical lesson plans to help students of all various learning
        styles and needs.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>My educational experience begins with my undergraduate
        studies at Aurora University in Aurora, Illinois. At Aurora University, I
        graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science with a focus on Mathematics
        Secondary Education. I am currently enrolled in the Learning Technologies
        and Design Master’s program at Mizzou University in Columbia, Missouri. I plan to graduate from Mizzou University
        with a master’s degree by next summer. The reason for studying this program is to improve my learning of
        instructional design to apply to various aspects of my career as a teacher.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
    <p>My favorite quote is...</p>
        <blockquote>"<em>Good</em> mathematics is not how many answers you know, it's how <em>you</em> behave when you don't." – Anonymous.</blockquote>
