    <h2>Statistics</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Statistic learning center! 
        We will be exploring the fundamental concepts of statistics and learn how to summarize data and interpret data from graphs! </p>

    <h3>Purpose of Learning Website</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to facilitate students learning and practice for our statistics unit in Algebra 1. 
        For many of my students, this is the first time they have heard and learned about statistics, so this website can help with their understanding of statistics. </p>
    
    <h3>Goal of this Website</h3>
    <p>The goal of this website is for students to demonstrate mastery of all the learning objectives in this unit by using a summative assessment to measure this at the end of the unit aiming for at least 80% accuracy. </p>
    
    <h3>Objectives of this Website</h3>
    <p>The objectives of this website are to provide students with the opportunity to practice their skills for each learning target by using practice problems, provide students with the opportunity to check their understanding throughout the unit by using formative assessments, and to provide students with resources to effectively prepare them for the summative assessment at the end of the unit. </p>

    <h3>Learning Objectives for Students</h3>
    <p>The learning objectives of this unit are the following: 
        <br/>Students will be able to calculate the measure of central tendency for a set of data (mean, median, and mode), 
        <br/>students will be able to calculate the measure of spread for a set of data (range and IQR), 
        <br/>and students will be able to create and interpret displays of data given a set of data values (dot plot, box plot, and histogram).</p>
